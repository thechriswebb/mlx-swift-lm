/// The two vision models this coverage runs against. Both were used to choose
/// the label rendering, so both are worth holding to it.
///
/// Qwen3-VL is deliberately not in this list. `mlx-community/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-4bit`
/// cannot load: its `model.safetensors.index.json` names
/// `model-00001-of-00002.safetensors` and `model-00002-of-00002.safetensors`,
/// neither of which the repo ships, and declares about 8.9 GB while the repo
/// contains a single 3.1 GB `model.safetensors`. The 8.9 GB figure is the
/// unquantized size, so the index was carried over from the source repo and
/// never regenerated for the quantized upload. The same is true of
/// `Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-4bit` (names four shards, ships two) and
/// `Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-8bit` (names two, ships one), so it is the
/// quantization batch rather than one repo. `Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct-4bit` is
/// packaged correctly if a Qwen3-VL model is ever wanted here.
///
/// Two things to know if you chase this again. The error reported through
/// `loadModelContainer`'s factory fallback reads as
/// `.unsupportedModelType("qwen3_vl")`, which is misleading: the real failure is
/// a file-not-found on the missing shard, and the LLM factory, which has no
/// qwen3_vl entry, is what reports last. And the weights themselves are fine:
/// pointing the loader at a copy of the directory with the index removed loads
/// the model and answers correctly, because `safetensorWeightURLs` only falls
/// back to globbing `*.safetensors` when no index is present.

/// declared, proving the labeled-attachment path reaches the already multimodal
/// MLX pipeline. Three tests live here: one names the color of a single image,
/// one picks which of two labeled images is a given color, and one takes a
/// generated reference to an input image and resolves it back to the attachment.
///
/// Inputs are synthetic solid-color squares built in-memory, no binary fixtures.
/// The color test is parameterized over two colors and asserts the model names
/// the matching color as a whole word. Two colors give an implicit negative
/// control, since a model that always answers "red" fails the blue case, and
/// word-level matching keeps "colored" and "coloured" from satisfying a color
/// name.

/// Skipped unless `MLX_RUN_VLM_INTEGRATION=1`, so default CI never downloads
/// multi-GB weights; run on Apple silicon on demand.

/// Setting that variable in your shell is not enough under `xcodebuild`, which
/// does not forward the parent environment into the test process. It has to be
/// prefixed, and `xcodebuild` strips the prefix on the way in:

/// Without the prefix every test here reports as skipped and the run still ends
/// in `** TEST SUCCEEDED **`, which reads exactly like a pass.
///
/// The OS gate is an in-body `guard #available` rather than an `@available`
/// on the suite: the swift-testing `@Suite`/`@Test` macros reject an
/// availability-annotated declaration here, so this mirrors the runtime gate
/// every other suite in this target uses (e.g. `IntegrationTests`).
