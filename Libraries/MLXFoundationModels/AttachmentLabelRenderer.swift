/// Turns FoundationModels attachment labels into the text an MLX chat message
/// can carry.
///
/// FoundationModels puts the label immediately before its image, as the literal
/// string `[label]`. That is not reachable here: an MLX `Chat.Message` holds one
/// text string plus an unnamed array of images, and every VLM message generator
/// emits all of a message's images ahead of its text. So the closest available
/// arrangement is a single line, placed before the caller's own text, naming the
/// labels in image order. Measured on Qwen3-VL-4B and gemma-4-e4b at two and
/// three images, both attribute a label to the right picture from this form as
/// reliably as they do from a per-image marker.
///
/// The bracket delimiters match FoundationModels deliberately. Models echo the
/// marker into their prose, so keeping the shape identical means an app can
/// scrub leaked labels with the same pattern it would use against the on-device
/// model.
